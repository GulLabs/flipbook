/**
 * Hard-cover BACK turns — closing a cover, rather than opening one.
 *
 * The mutation sweep that cleared the §4.1 soft path found its remaining
 * survivors clustered in one quadrant: a HARD leaf turning BACKWARD. The cause
 * is structural rather than an oversight — `e2e/golden-flip.spec.ts-snapshots`
 * has `hardcover-forward` at 25/50/75% and portrait/landscape soft folds in
 * both directions, but no `hardcover-back` cell at all. Five survivors lived in
 * exactly the missing one.
 *
 * These assert the drawn DOM, because in every case the defect is that a
 * different draw path ran, or that a transform carries the wrong sign — neither
 * of which a spy or an existence check can see.

  // version of this test asserted it through `bottomPage` under a describe
  // block about "the leaf under a BACK fold", which made it look like a
  // `setBottomPage` test. It is not, and the mutation sweep proved it:
  //
  //   * make `setBottomPage` stamp nothing at all — this test still PASSES;
  //   * invert `setFlippingPage`'s ternary — this is the ONLY test in the suite'

  // returns false exactly when the two are the same object. So
