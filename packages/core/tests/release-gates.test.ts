/**
 * Tests for the two release/supply-chain gates in `scripts/`.
 *
 * These live here because `packages/core/tests` is the only node-environment
 * vitest project in the repo; they test nothing in `packages/core/src`.
 *
 * Both gates are driven the way CI drives them — as a child process, asserted
 * on the EXIT CODE, never on the text of the output. A previous gate in this
 * repo printed both `644 passed` and `1 error`, exited non-zero, and was read as
 * green because someone grepped stdout.
 *
 * The negative fixtures are not hypothetical. Every one of them is a hole an
 * independent review (2026-08-29) demonstrated in the shipped version of these
 * scripts: guards satisfied by a `#` comment, by another job, by a step, or by
 * `always() || …`; `permissions: write-all` invisible to a `contents: write`
 * regex; and a React manifest with no `react-dom`, `react: "0"`, or a
 * nonexistent `^999.0.0` core range.
 *
 * The last fixture in each group is the negative control: semantically correct
 * input written differently must still PASS, or the gate is brittle rather than
 * strict, and the next maintainer will weaken it to get their build back.
