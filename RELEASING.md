# Releasing

This monorepo uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management and publishing to npm. Publishing is done by GitHub Actions, not from a developer machine. The pipeline matches [`gul-labs/any-llm`](https://github.com/gul-labs/any-llm).

## Provenance

This repository is public. The Release workflow requests `id-token: write` and sets `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=true` so every `changeset publish` attaches [npm provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements).

If the repository is ever made private again, npm will reject those provenance bundles (`E422 Unsupported GitHub Actions source repository visibility: "private"`). Disable both `id-token: write` and `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE` in that case.

When `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=true`, npm compares the manifest `repository.url` against the provenance attestation's `sourceRepositoryURI` (derived from the Actions OIDC claims, which include `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`). The org/repo path must be exactly `gul-labs/flipbook`. The comparison is literal, so it is not satisfied by different casing, and **not** by a GitHub redirect from a former org name either. A `git+https://….git` form is valid npm metadata; change the path only. The emergency laptop path does not attach this provenance bundle, so this is a CI-publish constraint.

The Release workflow fails fast if any public package's `repository.url` path does not equal `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, before `changeset publish` starts. `packages/core/tests/package-metadata.test.ts` asserts the same path on every public package and that this file lists each one. After an org/repo rename, update that test's `repoPath` first.

Registry provenance validation is not exercised by `npm publish --dry-run`. A rejected publish does not consume that package's version, so retry by rolling the path fix forward — never revert to a stale path. `changeset publish` is sequential: if a later package fails after an earlier one succeeded, the published versions are immutable. Before merging a metadata-only fix, verify with `npm view @gullabs/<pkg> version` and `git ls-remote --tags origin` and add a patch changeset for any version already on the registry. If a later Release still returns E422 after the path matches, check that `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE` actually attached a bundle rather than mutating the URL shape.

## How it works

1. **Add a changeset** while you work — which packages, which semver bump, what changed. (`@gullabs/flipbook-core` and `@gullabs/react-flipbook` are `fixed` and always move together.)
2. **Open and merge the feature PR to `main`.** Feature-branch CI does not publish.
3. **Let the `Release` workflow run after `main` CI succeeds.** `.github/workflows/release.yml` is triggered by a successful `CI` workflow run on `main`.
4. **Changesets decides whether to version or publish:**
   - Pending `.changeset/*.md` files → `changesets/action` opens a "Version Packages" PR.
   - Versions already bumped and no pending changesets → `changesets/action` runs `pnpm release` and publishes unpublished versions with the `NPM_TOKEN` secret.

Do not block a normal CI release on local `npm whoami`. Local npm auth is only for the emergency manual path.

## Day-to-day: adding a changeset

```bash
# From the repo root, on your feature branch:
pnpm changeset
```

The CLI asks which packages changed, the bump level, and a one-line summary. Commit the file under `.changeset/` with the code.

Docs-only, CI-only, and internal-chore PRs do not need a changeset.

## Release flow

```
feature branch  →  PR + changeset file merged to main
                        ↓
              GitHub Actions: Release workflow
                        ↓
         changesets/action opens "Version Packages" PR
         (bumps package.json versions + writes CHANGELOGs)
                        ↓
         Maintainer reviews & squash-merges "Version Packages" PR
                        ↓
              GitHub Actions: Release workflow
                        ↓
         changesets/action publishes to npm with provenance
         GitHub Release tags are created automatically
```

There is also a valid fast path when the feature branch already includes the version commit:

```
feature branch  →  PR with code + package.json/CHANGELOG version bumps merged to main
                        ↓
              GitHub Actions: CI succeeds on main
                        ↓
              GitHub Actions: Release workflow
                        ↓
         changesets/action publishes the already-versioned unpublished packages
```

Use only one path per release:

- **Normal path:** commit `.changeset/*.md`, merge to `main`, then merge the generated "Version Packages" PR.
- **Pre-versioned path:** run `pnpm version-packages` on the feature branch, commit package/changelog updates, and merge that PR directly to `main`.

Do not keep both a pending changeset file and a committed version bump for the same change.

## Packages published

All packages are published to the `@gullabs` scope with `publishConfig.access = "public"`:

| Package                   | npm                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `@gullabs/flipbook-core`  | https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gullabs/flipbook-core  |
| `@gullabs/react-flipbook` | https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gullabs/react-flipbook |

## Required repository secret

| Secret      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NPM_TOKEN` | npm automation token with publish access to the `@gullabs` scope. Same token used to publish the other `@gullabs/*` packages. Generate at https://www.npmjs.com/settings → Access Tokens → Generate New Token → Automation. |

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided by GitHub Actions. `release.yml` passes it to
`changesets/action@v2` as the **`github-token` input** (v2 no longer reads
`GITHUB_TOKEN` from the environment). The publish scripts still need npm auth:

The workflow sets both `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` (which the `.npmrc` written by `setup-node` expands) and `NPM_TOKEN` (which changesets reads). Setting only one fails publish with `ENEEDAUTH`.

### Scope the token to `@gullabs`, not to selected packages

This is the trap specific to a **first** publish, and it costs a full CI round
trip to discover. If you use a **granular access token**, its package permission
must be **"All packages in selected scopes and organizations" → `@gullabs`**.
npm's "Only select packages" list can only contain packages that already exist,
and neither `@gullabs/flipbook-core` nor `@gullabs/react-flipbook` does yet — so
a token scoped that way carries no permission for the name it is being used to
create, and publish fails `E403` on a package the token looks like it covers.
(The `@gullabs` scope itself must already exist; `gul-labs/any-llm` created it.)

A classic **automation** token has no such list and is fine. A classic
**publish** token is not: changesets runs non-interactively, so a token that
still wants an OTP fails `ERR_PNPM_OTP_NON_INTERACTIVE`, which changesets
reports as `failed:needs-2fa`.

### What actually runs at publish time

`changeset publish` detects pnpm and, per package, runs `pnpm pack` and then
`pnpm publish <tarball> --access public --tag latest --no-git-checks`. Three
consequences worth knowing:

- The **detached HEAD** this job checks out (`ref: workflow_run.head_sha`) is
  fine — `--no-git-checks` is passed for us.
- What ships is a **`pnpm pack` tarball**, which is exactly what
  `pnpm test:packed` (`scripts/check-packed-artifacts.mjs`) inspects, so that
  gate is checking the real artifact and not an approximation.
- `workspace:*` in `@gullabs/react-flipbook`'s dependency on the core is
  rewritten to the concrete version by `pnpm pack`. Verified in the packed
  manifest: `"@gullabs/flipbook-core": "3.0.0"`.

For the very first publish, changesets asks the registry (`pnpm info`) whether
each version exists; a 404 means "not published", so both packages publish even
though there is no pending changeset and no version bump. It does **not**
no-op.

## Manual release (emergency)

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm version-packages
changeset publish   # requires npm login on this machine
```

Prefer CI. A laptop publish will not attach the same provenance as the Actions OIDC identity.

## Snapshot / pre-releases

```bash
pnpm changeset pre enter alpha
# ... commit changesets as normal ...
pnpm changeset pre exit   # when ready to graduate
```

## Rollback / yank

If a bad version reaches npm:

1. **Do not force-push** git tags that already published.
2. **Deprecate** the bad version on **both** fixed packages (they move together):

   ```bash
   npm deprecate @gullabs/flipbook-core@X.Y.Z "Broken release; use X.Y.Z+1"
   npm deprecate @gullabs/react-flipbook@X.Y.Z "Broken release; use X.Y.Z+1"
   ```

3. Open a **patch** release via Changesets that fixes the defect and publish through the normal Release workflow.
4. Unpublish is rarely allowed after 72h and is discouraged; prefer deprecate + patch.
