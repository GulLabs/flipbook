/**
 * Statically prove that `.github/workflows/release.yml` cannot publish from a
 * fork.
 *
 * The Release workflow runs on `workflow_run`, which is the "pwn request"
 * trigger: it executes in the BASE repository with full secrets — `NPM_TOKEN`
 * and `contents: write` — and it fires for CI runs triggered by
 * `pull_request`, which `ci.yml` accepts from anywhere including forks.
 *
 * The `branches: [main]` filter on a `workflow_run` matches `head_branch`, and
 * for a fork PR that is the FORK's branch name. So a fork whose branch is
 * called `main` satisfies it. Without the guards below, that fork's commit is
 * checked out and built — `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` with their lockfile,
 * `tsup` with their config — inside a job that can publish to npm.
 *
 * These conditions cannot be unit-tested: GitHub Actions does not run locally.
 * So they are asserted statically instead, and this script is wired into the
 * quality gate.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A PARSER AND NOT A GREP
 * -----------------------------------
 * The first version of this file searched the whole workflow for four
 * substrings. An independent review (2026-08-29) showed that gate passes a
 * semantically unguarded release, because a substring can occur:
 *
 *   - inside a `#` comment (YAML never evaluates it),
 *   - on a DIFFERENT job than the one holding `NPM_TOKEN`,
 *   - inside `always() || <the real condition>`, which is always true,
 *   - as a step-level `if:`, which does not stop the job from checking out and
 *     installing the attacker's commit before that step is reached.
 *
 * It also missed `permissions: write-all` (its regex only matched
 * `contents: write`) and would have failed on semantically identical YAML
 * written with a different scalar style.
 *
 * So: parse the file, find the job that actually holds the publish token, and
 * assert against THAT JOB'S OWN `if:` expression. Comments are gone before we
 * look; formatting is gone before we look; other jobs are not consulted.
 *
 * Everything here FAILS CLOSED. If the workflow cannot be parsed, if no
 * publishing job can be identified, or if a condition cannot be understood,
 * the gate exits non-zero. A gate that cannot establish its claim must not
 * report that it did.
 *
 * Usage: `node scripts/check-workflow-guards.mjs [path/to/release.yml]`
 * The optional path exists so the gate can be driven against fixture
 * workflows — see `packages/core/tests/release-gates.test.ts`, which proves it
 * rejects each of the holes listed above.
